# CWHQ Python Email Series

## Category Ideas

### Preventing common errors

Show some common "gotchas" and ways to prevent them using Python features or general programming patterns.

- [Using Commas to Prevent Common Errors](emails/01__using-trailing-commas-to-prevent-common-errors.md)

### Interesting ways to use common functions/features 

There are everyday things that folks never do deep-dives on that can be fun to toy with like the additional arguments to `print()`, format-specifiers in f-strings, etc.

- [Fun Tricks With Python's `print()` Function](emails/02__fun-tricks-with-the-print-function.md) 
- Using format specifiers in f-strings to get interesting output formatting

### Spot the bug/error

Give a short program and ask readers to spot the error. Can give some hints.

### Python One-Liners

Don't necessarily have to be one-liners, but show ways to do things in a more elegant fashion than the "long way" that most folks learn when first starting out with Python.

- Conditional expressions
- Multiple assignment
- Iterating through a `list` with `print()`, the splat operator, and the `sep`/`end` params
- String multiplication

### Debugging Tips and Tricks

Useful functions, modules, or techniques for debugging.

- PDB
- Using the f"{variable_name=}" trick

### Refactoring Non-Pythonic Code

Folks come to Python from lots of different backgrounds, so showing some code that is technically correct and then refactoring it to conform to a more Pythonic style could be fun.
