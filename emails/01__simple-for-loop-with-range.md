## Question

What does the following program display?

```python
for num in range(5):
    print(num)

```

## Answer

```text
0
1
2
3
4
```

## Explanation

The `range()` function, when given a single argument (let's call it `n`) will produce a sequence of integers from 0 to `n` - 1. You can use the `for` loop to iterate over the sequence returned from the `range()` function.
